# odin_recipes

This project should demonstrate my (developing) ability to navigate Github, cli, and visual studios

I should be able to:
  create a repository for this project and clone it to my local device
  create commit messages throughout
  fill out typical boilerplate HTML
  perform basic html tasks (e.g headings, paragraph breaks, absolute and relative links, images)
