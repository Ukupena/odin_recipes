# odin_recipes

This project should demonstrate my (developing) ability to navigate Github, cli, and visual studios

I should be able to:
  <p>create a repository for this project and clone it to my local device</p>  
  <p>create commit messages throughout</p>
  <p>fill out typical boilerplate HTML</p>
  <p>perform basic html tasks (e.g headings, paragraph breaks, absolute and relative links, images)</p>
